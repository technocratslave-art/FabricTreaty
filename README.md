# FabricTreaty
FabricTreaty defines a hardware-agnostic protocol for deterministic, sovereign compute. It classifies accelerators by instruction jurisdiction and provides hardened systemd profiles that enforce low-latency, low-jitter execution. Includes a reference implementation for Apple Silicon (M1–M3) on Asahi Linux.
