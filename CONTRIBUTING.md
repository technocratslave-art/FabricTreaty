# Contributing to FabricTreaty

FabricTreaty is an OS-level determinism protocol. Contributions must preserve scope.

## What We Accept
- Documentation clarifications
- Additional reference implementations (clearly labeled)
- systemd profiles that enforce existing kernel primitives
- Corrections that improve determinism, portability, or clarity

## What We Do Not Accept
- AI frameworks, models, or runtimes
- Kernel patches or firmware interaction
- Vendor-specific hacks or reverse engineering
- Performance marketing or benchmark contests
- Claims of novelty beyond documented OS behavior

## Rules
- Doctrine remains hardware-agnostic
- Reference implementations must be opt-in
- Enforcement must use documented OS mechanisms
- AI remains a validating use case, not the scope

If a change alters scope, it will not be merged.
